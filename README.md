# Seattle-Housing-Regression-Analysis
A predictive model for housing prices in King County, Seattle using multiple regression.

# Project Overview
For this project, you will use regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

# The Data
This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in kc_house_data.csv in the data folder in this repo. The description of the column names can be found in column_names.md in the same folder.

# Business Problem {UPDATE!}
It is up to you to define a stakeholder and business problem appropriate to this dataset.

If you are struggling to define a stakeholder, we recommend you complete a project for a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and/or sell homes. A business problem you could focus on for this stakeholder is the need to provide advice to homeowners about how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount.

## Questions

## Methods
Data obtained from King Country housing dataset. Data was scrubbed and cleaned to remove outliers and null values (how did we fill nan??)

After assuring regression assumptions, we used Scikit-Learn and Statsmodels libraries to create a baseline model for predicting housing prices. Using train-test-split, we iterated on the model to remove collinearity, extraneous variables, and created features all while aiming for an improved R-squared value and reduced RMSE.
